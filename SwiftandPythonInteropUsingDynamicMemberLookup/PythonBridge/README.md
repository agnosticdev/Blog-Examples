# PythonBridge

Swift package that calls into a Python module to perform some actions and then passes the data back to Swift for display if needed.  An example here would be crunching some numbers on a website (Vapor) and then displaying the computed values.

**NOTE** The PythonBridge.swift file in this package was not originally written by me.  This file was an example file that supported the dynamic member lookup proposal that I altered for the demonstrational purposes of interacting with NumPy in Python.
